higher density than the adjacent waters.', ' The driving force behind a turbidity current is gravity acting on the high density of the sediments temporarily suspended within a fluid.', ' These semi-suspended solids make the average density of the sediment bearing water greater than that of the surrounding, undisturbed water.', ' As such currents flow, they often have a ""snow-balling-effect"", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current.', ' Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded.', ' Once an oceanic turbidity current reaches the calmer waters of the flatter area of the abyssal plain (main oceanic floor), the particles borne by the current settle out of the water
